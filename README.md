# Stabilised Light Gated Recurrent Units for Speech Recognition

The light gated recurrent units (Li-GRU) is well-known for achieving impressive results in automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks while being lighter and faster to train than a standard gated recurrent units (GRU). However, the Li-GRU suffered from a major problem of speed up due to the previous implementation that was relying on raw PyTorch. 

This repository provides a CUDA implementation of the Li-GRU as well as the new Stabilised Light Gated Recurrent Units (SLi-GRU) that you can direclty use with PyTorch. 

Will be updated soon! ðŸ¤–
